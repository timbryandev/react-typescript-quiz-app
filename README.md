# react-quiz

This project is based on the tutorial from Beau Carnes on [How to build a Quiz app using React and TypeScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-quiz-app-using-react-and-typescript/)

I have followed the video tutorial and will incrementally improve on their solution to better improve my understanding of React, Typescript and Styled Components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
